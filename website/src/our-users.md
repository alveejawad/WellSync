## Who is WellSync for?
WellSync is created to help patients and healthcare providers work together to improve on patient health.

### Patients:
WellSync will provide a user-friendly application to allow patients to log and track their mood, sleep, symptoms, medication-use and substance-use on a daily basis. Patients will also receive graphs and insights based on their logs. WellSync also enables easier communication between the patient and healthcare provider, which will reduce the frequency of appointments. WellSync aims to help the patient describe their symptoms when appointments do occur.

### Doctors:
WellSync aims to equip healthcare providers with a better means of obtaining their patients' health information through logs and easier communication. Doctors are able to provide personalized feedback and advice through the WellSync application.
