## Who is WellSync for?
WellSync exists to provide a space where patients and healthcare providers can work together to improve patient health outcomes.

### Patients:
WellSync is a user-friendly application allowing patients to keep track of their mood, sleep, symptoms, medication use and substance use on a daily basis. Patients do not need any technical knowledge to start using WellSync to communicate with their healthcare providers. Our efficient solution to healthcare record-keeping and communication benefits patients of all ages and walks of life. Patients with busy schedules, who have trouble finding time to visit and correspond with their healthcare provider, would benefit most from our solution. WellSync is also ideal for patients who prefer a regimented, data-driven approach to managing their health, since our solution works best when patients engage by completing their health logs daily.

### Doctors:
WellSync equips healthcare providers with tools for faster patient communication and daily access to patient health information. This solution is ideal for any medical practice seeking to modernize their operations, by reducing paper records and eliminating the need to arrange in-person appointments for simple status updates. Our solution is particularly effective when managing conditions that require frequent check-ins with the patient, since we encourage patients to fill out their wellness log every day. If you or your practice frequently deal with such issues, and are having difficulty keeping in touch regularly with patients, WellSync might be for you.
