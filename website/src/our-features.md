# Our features
Here at WellSync, we've designed our app to empower patients to take control over their health and help them connect with their healthcare providers efficiently. We've created features to help both healthcare providers and their patients keep track of health and well-being.

## Account Management:
- WellSync offers a personalized experience by allowing users to create accounts as either doctors or patients.
- Patients can personalize their account by updating their personal details.

## Daily Tracking:
- WellSync keeps patients motivated to stay on top of their wellness and recovery by encouraging daily logging of mood, sleep, symptoms, medications and substance use.
- Doctors can monitor their patients' conditions every day by viewing the information that their patients recorded.
- Doctors can also view the entire history of past patient logs, to track progress over time.
- Data visualizations of patient mood, sleep habits, and symptoms are available for the doctors to view on each patient individually, to help them identify notable patterns.

## Communication:
- Doctors can communicate with their patients by leaving them notes, which patients will then see on their WellSync homepage next time they log in.
