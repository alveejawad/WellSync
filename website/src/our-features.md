# Our features
Here at WellSync, we've designed our app to help empower patients to take control over their health and help connect their healthcare providers to them efficiently. We've created features to help both healthcare providers and patients monitor your health and well-being:

## Account Management:
• Wellsync offers a personalized experience by allowing users to create accounts as either doctors or patients.\
• Patients will be able to personalize their account by updating their personal information.

## Daily Tracking:
• Wellsync enables users to get a better sense of their days by allowing users to log their mood, sleep, symptoms, medications and substance-use on a daily basis. \
• Doctors will be able to monitor their patient's progress by having access to the patient's history of logs, if they patient permits. \

## Doctor Assessment:
• Doctors will be able to communicate with users by leaving notes and personalizing their patient's forms to allow faster communication.
• Patients and doctors will be able to receive statistics and graphs on logs such as their mood to help get a better understanding of their overall well-being.
