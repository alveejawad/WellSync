# Postmortem
This postmortem serves to recap the developmental process of the WellSync app, a collaborative health and wellness journal where patients can record updates on their physical and mental wellness for their care providers to review, and receive feedback in return. It explores some positive and negative points on some issues that arose during the entire process of development.

## What issues arose?

## Iteration 1
An issue that arose during iteration one of the developmental process was the last minute production of the actual code. As the deadline seemed to have been forgotten by most members as well as the team still figuring out how to gel with each other, time seemed to have slipped by as testing happened the night before the deadline. This was not ideal as it caused stress to build up early on in the process. Although this experience wasn't the best start for the team, it did allow for team chemistry to build as well as allowing the team to get a good gist of what time is needed for the entire developmental process. Another issue that occured because of last minute coding was the documentation process as some dev tasks and time being logged was documented very last minute as well. Although this was not a big problem towards the end, it may have caused for some inaccuracy in terms of time spent during the process (although still fairly accurate).

## Iteration 2
With iteration one being the catapult that helped iteration two get off to a good start, the team was able to properly distribute work as well as get work done for dates set by the team. By applying the different things learnt in class such as making sure code is low coupled & highly cohesive, making sure techincal debt isn't build built up and incorporating patterns such as the recycle view and the adapter pattern into our project; we were able to avoid code smells early on in our developmental process. As a team, we were able to find and fix certain SOLID violations found in iteration one. With that being said, an issue that still arose during developmental process for iteration two was that a lot of SRP (Solid-Responsibility Principle) and DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) violations were still violated by our code by the end of iteration two. Although this was not the best feedback to receive as it indicated that we were not properly avoiding SOLID violations, it still is good feedback to receive as our eyes were opened for avoiding SOLID violations in iteration three A.K.A the final release.

## Iteration 3
Also ensure that you discuss the area you identified for improvement after your iteration 2 retrospective; how did it go? \

## Conclusion

How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted? \
What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time? \
Can you draw any conclusions from what youâ€™ve done?
