# Postmortem
This postmortem serves to recap the developmental process of the WellSync app, a collaborative health and wellness journal where patients can record updates on their physical and mental wellness for their care providers to review, and receive feedback in return. It explores some positive and negative points on some issues that arose during the entire process of development.

## What issues arose?
Also ensure that you discuss the area you identified for improvement after your iteration 2 retrospective; how did it go? \
How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted? \
What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time? \
Can you draw any conclusions from what youâ€™ve done?
