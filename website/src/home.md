## Our vision
WellSync is a collaborative health and wellness journal where patients can record updates on their physical and mental wellness for their care providers to review, and receive feedback in return. With WellSync, patients will be able to record their mood, sleep, symptoms, medication and substance use, and other relevant health information on a daily basis. Selected information from patients’ health logs will be shared with their care providers, while keeping sensitive notes private to patients. Health care providers therefore have access to the history of their patients’ observations over time. They can use this information to curate their patients’ wellness goals, specify the symptoms they should be watching for, and communicate advice. Patients will then see their WellSync experience adapt as their practitioner follows along and responds to their health updates.
