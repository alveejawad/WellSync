## How to use
### Login
- Graders may log in to the app as a patient with the credentials `patient1@example.com`/`password1`
- Graders may log in to the app as a doctor with the credentials `doctor1@example.com`/`password1`
- Graders may create a new account as either a patient or a doctor.

To record a new wellness log and view it, graders must:
1. Log in as a patient
2. Record the daily log by using the trackers
3. Log out, and log back in as a doctor
4. Add the patient account using the patient's email (if not already present)
5. Click on the patient name, then the current date.

### Features
- Users can log in as patients, and update their profile information (e.g. name, sex, age, blood type).
- Users can log in as doctors and see their list of patients. For each of their patients, doctors can view personal information and the history of recorded daily logs. Doctors can add a new patient by specifying an email address associated with a patient account.
- Patients can record their daily log using all of the trackers (starting with the mood tracker), which is then visible by the doctor.
- Doctors can provide advice to send to each of their patients independently, which patients will then see on their home screen.
- Doctors can monitor their patients' progress visually using data charts, that represents a patient's mood, sleep habits, and most significant symptoms over time.
