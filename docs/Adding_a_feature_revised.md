### Adding a feature

In our WellSync project, we are going to discuss the story of our **Login page** feature which allows both patients and doctor to log in or sign up into the application.

We first started to work on the user stories related to the login page (which were created by the whole team). For the Login page feature, our team decided on what specific functionalities a login page feature needed to have in order for it to be a functinoal login page. Our team came up with two user stories: **Create an account** and **Log in as doctor or patient**. Each user story provided enough necessary information to create a few developer, which were assigned to each team member. Developer tasks were created based on our n-tier architecure, which includes layers for UI, Persistence, Logic and DSO. These developer tasks were created with a description, estimated cost (time) and a link to which user story it was linked to.

- [User_story_2](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2024/char-a02-16/-/issues/12)

After the work was distributed, team members were able to create seperate branches to work on specific developer tasks. After the feature specializations were finalized, the branches worked on were pushed back into the main project for it to merge the branch.

To guarantee the feature's functionality and also prevent any regression, the team also created comprehensive unit tests  to place concurrently with the current code. The test suit was executed to maintain code quality and reliability.

After each member pushed their branch back into gitlab, the team was able to collaborate and do a comprehensive code review to make necessary adjustments. Many merge commits was pushed to the main branch which combining everyone's code. This allowed the team to mark issues for the **Login** feature as being closed.
