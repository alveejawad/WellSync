## What has not been successful and how can we improve?
Our team's most recent release iteration has revealed areas in our project that can be improved upon, particularly with practices toward creating code that adheres to SOLID principles, communication and documentation. For example, our sign-up activity class (UI layer) was seen to be having instances of the logic layer implemented (role checker), which violates the SRP principle. Another example is that the validator classes where put under DSOs instead of the logic layer, which is another form of SRP violation. Lastly, our team also found instances of hard-coded data (symptoms, age, date, etc.) in our project, which would increase the need to maintain the project. In terms of communication, the team discussed that team members would be more responsible with communicating the code that was made to ensure proper review of the code would take place to avoid any SOLID violation. A lot of the work for iteration two was completed close to iteration two's deadline, which ultimately resulted in a generation of code that had smells to it. This could have easily been avoided by setting due dates or coding things early and making sure we were communicating the work finished/needed to be done through communication online or through meetings. A third problem was seen to be with documentation as there had been inconsistencies found in the time logged/time spent compared to iteration one. This can easily be improved upon by properly logging the time spent on a certain dev task.

## Determine concrete and realistic ways of improvement and decide how its success will be evaluated at the end of the iteration
One improvement that the team can incorporate for this upcoming retrospective is increasing the frequency meetings held online or in-person. By reducing the duration meetings are held for, team members can be more available to attend meetings to ensure team members are all on the same page. If meetings are still not a viable option, increasing the amount of messages should also help in ensuring that members are caught up with the current tasks that are needed to be finished. Once the team communication is at a certain level that the team is satisfied with, improvement should be seen in other areas of the project. This includes avoiding rushed tasks, proper documentation and a proper distribution of workload. Another area of improvement that the team can implement is practicing good coding that avoids any violation of the SOLID principles. If by the end of the iteration, the amount of SOLID principles violated are reduced to zero or one violation, the plan for improvement can be deemed successful. By the end of the third iteration, the number of meetings held/messages sent in the main method of communication online should be higher than the past two iterations as well as a decrease in, "smelly," code that potentially may violate any SOLID principle. If these two conditions are met, the plan for improvement will be deemed a success for this iteration. By focusing on these areas, we expect to see improvements in the cleanliness and maintainability of the project's code, which will ultimately translate to less stress and a better project experience.
