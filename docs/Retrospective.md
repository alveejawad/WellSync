### What went bad?

**1. Branching -** Some of us are using gitLab for the first time and we were unaware of the branching strategy. Initially, some of our commits were straight to main instead of our own directories.

**2. Late start -**  It took some time for us to adjust to everyone's busy schedules and come together as a group to work on the project.

### What went good?

**1. No merge conflicts -** We did not have any merge conflicts due to efficient communication between group members.

**2. Code did not crash -** The seamless operation of our code was attributed to the diligent review conducted by team members prior to committing.

**3. Assigned tasks -** Each team member diligently completed their assigned responsibilities in a timely manner ensuring efficient progress.

**4. Efficient work distribution -** Tasks were divided up according to the different layers- logic, UI, database and DSOs. Dispite the division, each member of the group collaborated across multiple layers as needed.

**5. Planning -** Our team invested a significant amount of time in the planning phase, which proved to be a successful strategy. This thorough planning process provided us with a clear vision of our objectives and tasks.

### What to improve?

**1. Branch names-** By being more consistent and including details the team deems necessary, we are able to improve our branch naming convention.

**2. Group meetings-** By having meetings at least twice a week, we are able to improve our communication by being on the same page.

**3. Review merge requests-** By assigning reviewers or reviewing merge requests during meetings, the team is able to improve the quality of the project.

**4. Smaller commits -** By creating smaller commits, the team is able to improve upon work productivity as members would have immediate access instead of waiting for a big commit to be pushed into the main branch.
