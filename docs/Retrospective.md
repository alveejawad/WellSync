### What went bad?

** 1. Branching - ** Some of us are using gitLab for the first time and we were unaware of the branching strategy. Initially, some of our commits were straight to main instead of our own directories.

** 2. Late start - **  It took some time for us to adjust to everyone's busy schedules and come together as a group to work on the project.

### What went good?

** 1. No merge conflicts - ** We did not have any merge conflicts due to efficient communication between group members.

** 2. Code did not crash - ** The seamless operation of our code was attributed to the diligent review conducted by team members prior to committing.

** 3. Assigned tasks - ** Each team member diligently completed their assigned responsibilities in a timely manner ensuring efficient progress.

** 4. Efficient work distribution - ** Tasks were divided up according to the different layers- logic, UI, database and DSOs. Dispite the division, each member of the group collaborated across multiple layers as needed.

** 5. Planning - ** Our team invested a significant amount of time in the planning phase, which proved to be a successful strategy. This thorough planning process provided us with a clear vision of our objectives and tasks.

### What to improve?

** 1. Branch names- ** Fix the naming of our branches according to branching convention.

** 2. Group meetings- ** Meet at least twice a week to check up on everyone's progress and to assist each other.

** 3. Review merge requests- ** Review as a group before merging 

** 4. Smaller commits - ** Make smaller commits instead of doing all of it in one commit.
